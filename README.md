# Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Dataset

This dataset consists of labeled chest X-ray images to support the development of machine learning models for pneumonia detection. It contains two categories:

- **Normal**: Healthy lung X-rays.
- **Pneumonia**: X-rays showing evidence of pneumonia.

The dataset is divided into `train` and `test` directories for model training and evaluation. It offers a valuable resource for advancing automated diagnostic tools in medical imaging.
